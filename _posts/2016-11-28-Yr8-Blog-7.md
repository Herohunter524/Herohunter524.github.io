    <td>I learnt that if you wanted to ask a question or store information in coding you have to use variables so the FUZE knows what it is talking about. For instance if I wanted ask someone's age in code I would have to state what age$ is equal to, and where to find that information.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was probably talking about the work for a bit too long rather than actually doing it in that particular moment. Although I did not do this often I could have been quicker if I hadn't done it on those rare occasions</td>

    <td>I will try to concentrate fully in the lessons, and try to work even swifter, so that my partner and I can try to get onto the robot arm. I will improve my learning by trying to understand the code more so I can work through it quicker</td>
