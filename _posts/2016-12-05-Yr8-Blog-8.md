    <td>We started by trying to duplicate what was in the information booklet so it would be exactly the same. This worked for a while, but some of the labels in the picture started to deviate from the ones on our actual FUZE box.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I think that I should have looked at the actual info about the electronics set more instead of just looking at the image and guessing what it all meant. I will try to rectify this in the lesson next week</td>

    <td>I will properly inspect the text about the electronics so I know exactly what I am doing next time. With this hopefully I can get onto the robot arm</td>
