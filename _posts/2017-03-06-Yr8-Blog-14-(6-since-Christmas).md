    <td>I learnt by checking my style.scss file and checking different colours I was using and maybe change those and I also wanted to change the colours of the table and try using multiple. I think this improves my blog. </td>

    <td>I have 6 blogs over 8 weeks since christmas, so I think what limited my learning was maybe missing out 2 blogs throughout those 8 weeks.</td>
