  <tr>
    <td>I learnt in this lesson by trying different methods to answer a section, and even sometimes when I got it right, I wouldn't move on to the next section, I would restart it and try a different method so I could confirm and understand it more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning, although I could try to focus on my own work more, instead of answering my peers questions, so I can get even more work done in lesson time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I work through the sections, this time trying to exactly what the instructions say, instead of using multiple methods that maybe go round the instructions, as this will help me get better and more efficient in my coding.</td>
