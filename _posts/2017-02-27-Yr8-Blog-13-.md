    <td>I learnt by just working through the exercises very quickly, but thoroughly. This was effective as I managed to get 5% done in the lesson.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning, so I could try and get even more work done in lessons and do maybe 2% percent at home. Although this time I managed to do 5% at home</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way I work through the sections, this time trying to exactly what the instructions say, instead of using multiple methods that maybe go round the instructions, as this will help me get better and more efficient in my coding.</td>
