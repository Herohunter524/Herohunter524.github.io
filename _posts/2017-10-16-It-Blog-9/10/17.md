    <td>In this lesson, we learnt to create shapes and objects using a code drawer known as 'Turtle'. This interface relies on using directions to almost map where you want lines to be drawn ( In pixels). You can change to speed of the drawing, and many other colours and avatars for the drawing cursor can be accessed. In the lesson we started off by looking at some examples. I, for example, looked at how you could make a house simply with a few lines here and there. I learnt that you could have different colours in the same design, and could make much more complex depictions by layering the lines, creating gradients that blend together. Our homework from this lesson was to find a cool design for Mr Keen, and I found code that someone had designed to simulate tree growth. I find it very interesting</td>
