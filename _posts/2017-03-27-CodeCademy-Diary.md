On Monday (when I had IT), I did 10 minutes of CodeCademy practice where I went back to 'Student becomes the teacher' just to go over the code because I didn’t really understand some of it’. On Wednesday I did 10 mins of CodeCademy Where I got to 11% on the new section ‘Lists and Functions’. I understood this code. On Thursday I had only a bit of free time so I did 5 mins of CodeCademy practice where I got up to 22% on lists and functions.

Unfortunately I didn't get to do anymore practice as I didn’t have time.
