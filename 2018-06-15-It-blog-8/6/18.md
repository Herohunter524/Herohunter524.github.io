    <td>I went onto my python and tried to retrace my steps on my code so that I could see if had retained any of the knowledge I had use before. I was able to create a function, which is a start until next lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was the singular fact that I could not remember how to achieve some of the outcomes that I was able to in the past. I need to re-learn these methods so that I can get back into the swing of things.</td>
